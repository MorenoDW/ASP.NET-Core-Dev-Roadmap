# ASP.NET Core MVC

ASP.NET Core MVC is a rich framework for building web apps and APIs using the Model-View-Controller design pattern.

## MVC Pattern

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern separates an application into three main groups of components: Models, Views and Controllers. This pattern helps to achieve [separation of concerns] (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/modern-web-apps-azure/architectural-principles#separation-of-concerns).
