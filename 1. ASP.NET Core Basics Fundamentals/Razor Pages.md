# ASP.NET Razor

**Razor** is an ASP.NET programming syntax and a server side markup language, used to create dynamic web pages with the c# or VB:NET programming languages. Razor was in development in June 2021 and was released for Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 in January 2011. Razor is a simple-syntax view engine and was released as part of MVC 3 and the WebMatrix tool set.

Razor became a component of AspNetWebStack and then became a part of ASP.NET Core.

## Design

The Razor syntax is a template markup syntax, based on the c# programming language, that enables the programmer to use an HTML construction workflow. Instead of using the ASP.NET Web Forms (.aspx) markup syntax with `<%= %>` symbols to indicate code blocks, Razor syntax starts code blocks with an `@` character and does not require explicit closing of the code-block.

The idea behind Razor is to provide an optimized syntax for HTML generation using a code-focused templating approach, with minimal transition between HTML and code. The design reduces the number of characters and keystrokes, and enables a more fluid coding workflow by not requiring explicitly denoted server blocks within the HTML code.
